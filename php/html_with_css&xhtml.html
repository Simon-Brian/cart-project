<p>
so in my virtual meetup i was the only attendee and was sure enough not expecting any visitors and sadly enpough was horrified at the fact that <em>i can hold my self</em> together at this horrible time in life but sure enough qwerty shoed up in a blue jeans.

<h2>
	my ordeal that day
</h2>
<p>
	i was bashed around and never sow my full potential through but god has given me a second chance <b>"thanks GOD"</b>i must then get to working and make a dream productive day that i never had in my life after form 2 at <i>kahuho uhuru high school</i><blockquote>located in kikuyu zambezi area near a local supermarket 
	</blockquote>but god is great and i made it through this way far now all i have done for the past weeks is physical work and non mental exercises.
